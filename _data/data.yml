    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I started programming during my teen years beginning with <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. 
      I somewhat learnt how to use some of its modules such as <a href="https://www.pygame.org">PyGame</a>
      and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, and wrote several scripts to automate tasks.
      I then started making video games using the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game engine and
      learnt how to code in C#.<br><br>In 2018, I was a Google Code-In finalist. I worked a lot on network 
      related technologies and made use of <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> and
      <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> during the contest. I configured virtual machines running
      on <a href="https://openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a> in <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, 
      hosted local servers, most of which on either <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> or 
      <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a>, made web interfaces and improved documentation. To this day,
      I'm always learning new things while contributing to GitHub by participating in events such as
      <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> Hackathons during which I usually implement secure algorithms
      such as SSH-XMSS and TLS 1.3. Additionally, I'm representing my country in such events by being a 
      <a href="https://cyberstorm.mu">CyberStorm.mu</a> member.<br><br> Being a Linux lover, I made my own
      Distro named  <a href="https://os.kinesis.games">Kinesis OS</a> bundled with many useful bash scripts,
      which uses <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>'s package manager; pacman. In 2019, I was a
      mentor for Google Code-in with my former organisation; <a href="http://openwisp.org">OpenWISP</a>.
      During my free time, I'm  experimenting new ways of developing websites and creating games or apps.
      In the pursuit of improving my devops skills, I experimented a lot with <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> 
      and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.

      details: |
        As assignments, I had to outsource servers, both internal and external ones.
        Via a suite of tools, I also had to analyze logs and perform regular scans in
        order to prevent any risks for our customers. Servers additionally often had to be deployed,
        installed, configured or updated while making sure to be using latest patches.<br><br>
        My daily tasks often required me to mess with <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>,
        <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>.
