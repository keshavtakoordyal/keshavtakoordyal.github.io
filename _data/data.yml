    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I started programming during my teen years beginning with python. 
      I somewhat learnt how to use some of its modules such as pygame and django. I then started making 
      video games using the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game engine and learnt how to code in c#.<br><br>In 2018, I was a 
      Google Code-In finalist. I worked a lot on network related technologies and made use of Ansible and Docker 
      during the contest. I configured virtual machines running on OpenWRT in <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, 
      hosted local servers, some of which on <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a>, made web interfaces and improved documentation. 
      To this day, I'm always learning new things while contributing to GitHub by 
      participating in events such as IETF Hackathons during which I usually implement secure algorithms such as 
      SSH-XMSS and TLS 1.3. Additionally, I'm representing my country in such events by being a 
      <a href="https://cyberstorm.mu">CyberStorm.mu</a> member.<br><br> Being a Linux lover, I made my own Distro named 
      <a href="https://os.kinesis.games">Kinesis OS</a> bundled with many useful bash scripts, which uses 
      <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>'s package manager; pacman. In 2019, I was a mentor for Google Code-in 
      with my former organisation; <a href="http://openwisp.org">OpenWISP</a>. During my free time, I'm  experimenting new ways of developing websites 
      and creating games or apps. You can find some of my achievements on <a href="www.sololearn.com/Profile/1157133">SoloLearn</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/edgeking810">FreeCodeCamp</a>.
